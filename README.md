# THE GAME

This will be an ongoing project, whenever I get around to doing more of it.

The first parts of this project will be following 1-1 with the Handmade Hero series by Casey Muratori.

This is because I dont have the faintest idea of how to program a platform layer to a game engine.

Once we get to the game design portion I will diverge pretty quickly I think,  
but will still use the resources from the series.

I will fix up the repo shortly, and get the licenses and processes sorted out

Lets get going. :)
